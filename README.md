The Plugin can switch between being a chorus effect and a delay.

There are options for time/rate, feedback/depth, wet/dry and a filter option.

The filter can be switched on and off. It has a cutoff slider and can choose between low/high/bandpass.
It has a preset management system that can store and load different parameter presets and name them.

There are VU meters for the input and output of the effect and nice looking buttons, fonts and backgrounds.
