# Chorus-Delay-Plugin
A Chorus and Delay Plugin with a minimalist style.

The Plugin can switch between being a chorus effect and a delay.
There are options for time/rate, feedback/depth, wet/dry and a filter option.
The filter can be switched on and off. It has a cutoff slider and can choose between low/high/bandpass.
It has a preset management system that can store and load different parameter presets and name them.
